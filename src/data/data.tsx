Working as a group of 4 over the course of 5 days, we decided on developing the student-hub that would hold the 4 main links (zoom, Notion, Slack and Github) used daily and to be a repository of topics where students could seach for a topic e.g React and be provided with the heading, a brief overview and some links. Stretch goals were to allow students to add to the this repository so it could continue to grow.",
