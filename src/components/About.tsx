                Originally a southerner, I have migrated north and currently
                live in Sheffield with my family. Providing for my family and being a good role model
                to the boys is a big motivator for me. I want a career I can be
                proud of and that gives a platform for us to experience life and
                grow without limitations.

                I like to push myself to be the best I can. I am personable, a
                logical thinker and really enjoy problem solving which have been
                key strengths throughout my career. I like to feel I'm
                progressing whether that's in a chosen sport or professionally
                and am prepared to step out of my comfort zone to test myself
                and grow.

                Within touching distance of the Peak District (why I moved to
                Sheffield), when I'm not coding I can be found climbing, road or
                mountain biking. Sarah and I have both travelled the world for
                climbing and adventure. Two boys provide a little extra
                logistical consideration but we are instilling a sense of
                adventure and travel in them at every opportunity.
